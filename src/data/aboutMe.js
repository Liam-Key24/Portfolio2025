    bio: "I'm Gabriel, a tech enthusiast, art lover, and avid traveler. Starting as a graphic designer at Lalaland, I mastered design and storytelling, focusing on posters and social media. Venturing into fashion, I founded Static—a zero-waste brand—and expanded into ceramics with Static Lemonade. My passion for design led me to frontend development, where I merge creativity with technical skills to craft visually stunning websites. Beyond work, I stay updated on tech and design trends, eager to innovate in this dynamic field",
